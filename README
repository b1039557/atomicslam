created project called atomicslam
created a directory call assignment using mkdir assignment
created new applictaion called Placements

ran the application and enter http://localhost:8080/Placements into the browser
Modified Placements application -->  index.gsp file to changed view I ran         gedit  ./application.properties      cmd  

used git push ---> to push changes upto git hub

I much better understand the idea of MVC :~)

----------------------------creating my domains classes-----------------------
created domain  grails create-domain-class Student 
created domain  grails create-domain-class Application
created domain  grails create-domain-class Status
created domain  grails create-domain-class Oppurtunity 

modified each groovy eg Student.groovy with the neccessary properties required
forgot to add PlacementOppurtunity properties and then added them 

---------------------------Generating scaffolding----------------------------
to generate scaffolding for a particular domain :  
domain class placements.Application
domain class placements.Status

generated all scaffolding for all the domains


import placement.Student
import placement.Status
import placement.Application
import placement.PlacementOppurtunity   

  def  studentumair = new Student(name:'umair',courseCode:'T500', notes:'talanted' ,applications:'five').save();

created some test data using the scaffolding and through bootstrap


---------------------------errors-------------------------------------------

erros in the past, in the domain class Student when i was making variable i was not using the camel case standard for variables eg String CourseCode --> courseCode :) ryt, tried using google to solve this but but got responce from ian hurray :) 
which solved the issue

i forgot to enter the required properties for PlacementOppurtunity.groovy and generated the scaffolding, when when i navigated to this file in the browser there were no properties listed, then i added the required properties and run the cmd command once again overwriting the existing scaffolding, which solved the problem

obtained a number of errors whilst assigning default status codes for the application

had issues with bootstrap regarding compilations erros with miss spelt words
